Hello! I'm **Piotrek Szkopiak** and this is my training project to improve my skills for data science, specially - _data analyse_ and _data visualization. I use knowledge from last project to make things more effective :nerd_face:

### Overview

Primary goal is to compare this indexes to check bussiness' owners sentiments and correlation between theme:

I use `Jupyter Notebook` for easy notes, comments and real time working with code. Programming language is Python - `Pandas` with `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn`. Data from Office are in `.csv` format.
